# IVD has moved

IVD has moved to [src.enesda.com](https://src.enesda.com/nursery/IVD)

The move is partly in protest of microsoft's consolidation of open source development, and "fuck you" attitude towards using code for training billion dollar products which enables mass violation of the rights of the authors.

Somewhat unrelated is that it was also relicensed under the terms of the LGPL3. I humbly ask that anyone in possession of a copy of the original Apache 2.0 version of the code destroy such copies and clone the new release.
